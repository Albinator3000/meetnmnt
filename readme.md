## Features

- PWA ready
- 100% lighthouse scores
- Dark mode ðŸŒš
- Eslint/prettier working with typescript

## Known issues

- Dark mode doesn't always toggle when added to home screen
- Statusbar is unreadable in light mode
- Needs apple splash screen images and meta tags
- Web manifest/meta tags could probably be optimised? More icon sizes maybe?
